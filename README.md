## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Libraries used found in the Anaconda distribution of Python. This code works with Python version 3.

## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>
Identify customer segments for a mail order company selling organic products in Germany using unsupervised machine learning. Predict individuals likely to become a new customer using unsupervised and supervised machine learning models. There are 4 data sets with anonymized demographic info provided by Arvato Financial Solutions:Â 
- Germany population demographics with 366 features (891,211 individuals)
- Existing mail order customer demographics with 366 features (191,652 individuals)
- Demographics for individuals targeted in a 2018 mail order campaign, including success/failure to onboard (42,982 individuals)
- Demographics for individuals targeted in a 2018 mail order campaign, without the inclusion of success/failure to onboard (42,833 individuals)
