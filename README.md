## Installation<a name="installation"></a>

Libraries used found in the Anaconda distribution of Python, Apache PySpark ML , Apache Spark SQL. This code works with Python version 3 and Spark version 2.4.5.

## Project Overview<a name="overview"></a>
Identify existing free and paying customers on a streaming music platform called 'Sparkify' (fictitious company, much like Spotify) who are most likely to churn (based on data attributes 'gender','free/paying customer', 'city+state', and 'State'. Data set based on a much smaller subset of entire platform:
- Data set contains 286,500 records

## Background<a name="background"></a> 
This is an assignment for the Udacity Data Scientist nano degree program. 

## File Descriptions<a name="descriptions"></a> 
- Sparkify.ipynb: Jupyter notebook with coding

## Results<a name="results"></a> 
- A business explanation of the results can be found on Medium: https://medium.com/@scott.m.pena/using-spark-ml-to-predict-churn-on-a-streaming-music-platform-e22b6fc91b8e
- CRISP-DM process flow, coding, and technical notation found within the Jupyter notebook
